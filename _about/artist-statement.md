## Artist Statement

My research is highly involved with archipelago items and island life, customs and visual emotions that run through the cultural lines of Asia and the Pacific as a whole.

I work with multiple 'woodblocks', each time applying a wash of colour, and in many variable methods, focusing on details, I then weave these methods together so that when the painting is viewed as a whole a new visual emotion is revealed.

I build up a painting by layers. Sometimes I print using the Javanese ‘Cap’ Batik stamps.

I draw ‘Rumah Adat’, represent the ‘Living House’, use marine charts, play with coral shapes and landscape forms.
