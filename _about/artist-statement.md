## Layers of Life, Layers of Art

Art is not merely an act of creation; it is a dialogue between memory, experience, and emotion.

The way layers interact, how color seeps through delicate rice paper, and how a carved woodblock leaves its imperfect yet deliberate imprint—all these elements build a visual and emotional depth.

My artistic process mirrors the act of constructing and deconstructing, much like the way we collect experiences and weave them into our personal narratives.

Each layer holds a story—some visible, some concealed—just as cultures, landscapes, and fleeting impressions remain within us long after we have left them behind.

I was born into a world of rich artistic heritage, growing up in Bali during a time when kerosene lamps flickered in the twilight and the rhythms of daily life were inseparable from art.

My childhood was steeped in cultural immersion—traveling, spending time on secluded beaches, and forging deep connections with the local Balinese way of life.

Art was omnipresent, woven into the intricate patterns of batik textiles, wooden carvings, offering making, paintings painted in natural pigments, smells of nature,storytelling through shadow puppets and dance.

Without conscious intent, I was absorbing a visual language, one that would later define my artistic identity.

Education, for me, was an unconventional path—an amalgamation of local schooling and correspondence courses.

Yet, the desire of my family to explore beyond the confines of my birthplace led us first to Australia,around the world and back again to Bali and later to a boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas.

The striking contrasts of these landscapes—Bali’s lush, tropical warmth against the Himalayas’ vast, towering serenity—deepened my understanding of composition, color, and atmosphere.

These diverse environments shaped my visual sensibilities, embedding within me a sensitivity to texture, contrast, and movement.

My formal artistic training took root at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in the late 1980s, where I studied textile design and screen printing.

This period of academic rigor refined my understanding of layering, both technically and conceptually.

Screen printing, with its precision and repetition, taught me the discipline of pattern-making, while my upbringing had instilled in me an organic appreciation for depth and texture.

Research became an integral part of my artistic practice—studying textiles, analyzing historical print techniques, and drawing connections between traditional craftsmanship and contemporary artistic expression.

Today, my work is a synthesis of these experiences, a confluence of technique and meaning.

I employ collaging, woodblock printing, and translucent washes of color to construct an atmosphere imbued with memory and movement.

Rice paper, with its delicate transparency, allows for an interplay between layers, echoing the way recollections overlap and merge over time.

The rhythmic patterns of woodblock printing reference my background in textile design, bringing an element of structure and repetition.

Maps, stamps, and remnants of past travels find their way into my compositions, acting as fragments of a broader narrative—a palimpsest of places, histories, and identities interwoven.

For me, art transcends the mere act of image-making; it serves as a vessel for deeper resonance.

The interplay of color, the imperfect mark of a carved block, the textural interplay of layered materials—each element contributes to an intricate dialogue between past and present, personal and universal.

My work seeks to evoke an emotional connection, a sense of familiarity within the unfamiliar, as if the viewer is transported to a place they have never been, yet somehow recognize.

At its core, my artistic practice is an exploration of layered histories. Art is my way of bridging worlds—melding Eastern and Western influences, tradition and innovation, past and present.

It is a lifelong journey, one that began on the beaches of Bali, extended to the peaks of the Himalayas, and continues to evolve with every new place, texture, and story I encounter.
